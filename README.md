# 📝 MD Notebook v0.0.1

**MD Notebook** is a lightweight Markdown editor and previewer designed for simplicity and efficiency. This tool is perfect for users who want to quickly preview Markdown files without the need to open heavyweight IDEs like Xcode or VSCode. The goal of this project is to provide a minimalistic experience with just enough functionality to make Markdown editing intuitive and fast.

## 🚀 Features (v0.0.1)

- Live Markdown preview using the `marked` package for JavaScript.
- Lightweight and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity.
- **Current Limitations**:
  - No file-saving or file-opening capabilities (yet).
  - Syntax highlighting for code blocks is not yet supported.
  - No LaTeX or HTML parsing support—coming in future versions!

## 📚 Planned Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Add language-specific syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- **LaTeX Support**: Add LaTeX equation parsing for mathematical expressions.
- **HTML Parsing**: Enable secure HTML parsing to enrich the Markdown preview.
- **File Operations**: Add functionality to save and open Markdown files.

Contributions are welcome! The goal is to keep the tool lightweight and efficient, so only essential features will be added.
